Find 5 Conference at that time, we understand that it is the world\'s first smartphone that hardware support HDR. It supports HDR video without a cell phone can be done before; it can also preview in real time, without having to post, use Find5 before shooting, you can see the results, you can choose the best composition and light, and then press the shutter, take pictures of the most beautiful. Hardware support, HDR how powerful is the phone? Small series of science under the bar.  What is HDR?High Dynamic Range HDR is English (high dynamic range) abbreviation. In the context of greater light than shooting, ordinary limited by the dynamic range of the camera not record details of extremely bright or dark. The HDR processing photos, even under greater light than shooting, regardless of high light and dark have access to higher level than ordinary photos. And the so-called \"dynamic range\" refers to the image or images can be represented by the device signal the maximum and minimum values of the ratio.  HDR good for?[![Alt Moschino mini case](http://www.nodcase.com/images/large/ipad/moschino_mi607_lrg.jpg)](http://www.nodcase.com/moschino-french-fries-ipad-mini-case-p-3511.html)HDR techniques can restore photos right in the light and shadow detail, enhance photo color tolerance.

Through the picture proofs, it can feel the power of HDR.Digital camera manufacturers has been focused on the development a higher dynamic range of hardware with built-in features. One of Fuji is the best, as early as in 2004 launched the high dynamic range SuperCCD SR, with half the pixels used to record normal brightness, and the other half to record images of the dark, and to its digital SLR camera on the S3 Pro. Digital SLR cameras of other brands have launched after improving the dynamic range of the image functions, such as Active D-Lighting Nikon, Canon highlight priority modes, dynamic range expansion feature of the Pentax and Sony D-Range Optimizer, enhance the level of pictures in a simple way. Later, even the small DC also began to join the high dynamic range feature, such as Fuji, Nikon, Ricoh, such as some models have similar features.
