title: Microsoft: the Windows Hello may refuse to buy new equipment

Although Microsoft released Windows10 announced a new identification tool called the Windows Hello, but it seems there is not much real experience, because not all existing hardware is compatible with Windows Hello. Have bought Microsoft\'s third son--Surface Pro 3 nuts is for the people, because no matter how the system update does not support this feature. As the camera recognize faces the Windows Hello, is not the same as Android 5.0-based face recognition software update camera hardware must also be supported.

Everyone is familiar with the fingerprint, which swept the fingerprint process, collecting the entire finger needs to repeat 10 to 20 times before he can be successful. But for setting is Windows Hello can be completed in less than half a minute--just so you can sit in front of the camera to normal sitting posture without looking. You further enhance recognition test was probably 10-20 seconds to complete.　　To achieve fast reaction speed, while maintaining enterprise-level security level, you must have hardware support. Intel RealSense published by the Microsoft technologies as one of the official certification of the standard, this technology allows the two cameras turn to complete the facial features and physiological activity of complex judgments. General computer\'s front-facing camera, call quality concerns itself with people, are unable to complete the task.　　Intel released the latest preinstall Windows 10 models, only the balance more than 10 can support WindowsHello technology. In order to experience the pleasure of this land, and don\'t need to buy a computer-or at least equipped with a RealSense camera, you need to spend $ 99 and camera card in the laptop lid?　　Microsoft China SurfacePro 4 tasting, held the meeting yesterday I asked him about this problem. Of course we all know SurfacePro 4 supports Windows Hello, but the mode is not RealSense--because it supports the technical hardware is too large, but with a Microsoft technology.　　In the Surface Pro 4 on the front panel, front-facing camera is only one instead of two, but equipped with a hardware-the infra-red sensor. At the login screen to find face time, and infra-red led will light up at the top of the screen about 1-2 seconds, helping confirm that this person is in fever. And camera main function is to judge the person\'s facial features and actions necessary to meet. This way you can judge sitting in front of you is a living thing, is to play a video in full screen.

We know that on the screen to install a portable infrared detector, are much more likely than other solutions.　　But Microsoft gave us pouring cold water, because the technology is still belongs to Microsoft\'s internal technical, just a Hack, currently there are no published criteria. So Microsoft could not be immediately known how can common OEM manufacturers are compatible. And Microsoft will not develop an open standard and API, there is no official certification. We all know that each generation of Windows system compatible device fitted with a logo, but there is only Windows logo certification, that is, the device can be run under Windows, not Windows Hello certification logo.　　As biometric identification, intention to cancel the traditional Windows password Hello, but is not limited to human face recognition, other methods including fingerprints and iris recognition – iris recognition is the latest Microsoft Lumia, launch--it\'s on a mobile phone. So, for machines in the past, some machines are the traditional fingerprint reader is installed, they can be judged on the new system to a compatible WindowsHello?　　Fact, it is a big problem. The only problem is that you have to use the system control panel to manage your fingerprint identification device, if your system, such as ThinkPad, original fingerprint identification software to manage on their own, so both sides appears mutual problems to win the right to take over. You may need to remove the random preinstalled third-party software instead of Windows systems to manage, so that you can see the lock screen to let you itching for a long time little face.![Alt Microsoft: the Windows Hello may refuse to buy new equipment](https://c2.staticflickr.com/6/5697/23297412284_772e2676a4_b.jpg)![Alt Microsoft: the Windows Hello may refuse to buy new equipment](https://c2.staticflickr.com/6/5748/23629959400_c2b5db7ea2_z.jpg)![Alt Microsoft: the Windows Hello may refuse to buy new equipment](https://c2.staticflickr.com/2/1450/23557778739_5cb97b5d5a_b.jpg)![Alt Microsoft: the Windows Hello may refuse to buy new equipment](https://c2.staticflickr.com/2/1503/23629970510_b27608f2c1_b.jpg)[Article correction]Collection is the collection of 1542Tags:PC and hardware Science and technology
