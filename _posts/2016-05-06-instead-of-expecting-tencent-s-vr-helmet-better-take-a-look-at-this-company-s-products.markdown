Two adjacent Conference, not only similar, do something very similar, but the style is different.Tencent: layout, but there is no technical detailsBrief review of yesterday\'s press conference, Tencent issued VR SDK 1.0, mainly imported from the image rendering component, component, audio and video components, account, and payment transactions components consists of 5 major functional component parts. Also announced three products (host PC, game consoles and mobile VR) and lay out, the introduction of hardware. In addition, there is cooperation and the developer support program. Tencent\'s strategy is to make the ecological, and tries not to do its own brand of hardware.Tencent\'s layout is very large, surface natural road, media calls it \"ambitions comparable to the app\". But the problem is that such a blueprint without focus, or see how many technical details, it recognizes the VR is currently experiencing problems, but offered no specific solutions. Asked by a reporter, \"Tencent compared to Samsung and other international companies have any advantages? \"The results and the answer is,\" we know more about the Chinese market as domestic manufacturers, there are more domestic resources. \" Yes, but does not answer the question.Lei Feng network reported in April this year, Tencent VR is a division of pit strategy, is spending only to test the waters, it\'s hard to have a big impact on the industry. Although products cannot say Tencent VR technology, but earlier Xinhua saw a VR in Shenzhen venture company CTO, he proudly said Tencent VR is they are doing, and journalists to experience their products, and as any normal-made helmet and and nothing amazing about it.Fireworks workshop: problem solvingThen Fireworks workshops to today\'s Conference, they released products, including:1, according to the developer\'s Fireworks workshop \"Dawn\" Developers Kit (FiresVR Dawn SDK V0.9);2, built nine-axis gyro and interactive buttons, at $ 199 no VR glasses \"-1\" (), and open hardware development standards;3, a VR operating system OS and application markets;4, for the fireworks industry partners demonstrating the cinema and VR the final glory of the original game.Fireworks next will develop integrated VR helmet. Fireworks is also a software rather than hardware company, CEO Lou pool has repeatedly stressed that \"hardware is being forced, and because there are no good hardware.\" Fireworks\'s goal is to make the ecological, open hardware development standard is to try to win more hardware vendors. And Tencent VR strategies like, unlike the Fireworks clearly focused mobile VR, has launched products, and solve the problem of mobile VR provides a solution.![Alt Instead of expecting Tencent\'s VR helmet, better take a look at this company\'s products](http://kenzo2016.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/783396d3.jpeg)(Very scene renderings of the V-1)If you experience any domestic phone VR helmets, easily found a variety of problems, including dizziness, delayed, pictures, sand drift net effect (not clear), cell phone adapters, cell phone overheated, the fog of the lens, and so on. Fireworks workshops in and solutions to these problems are:1, delay: based on asynchronous time warp (ATW), color correction and anti-distortion, Unity and Hack Android optimized, attitude sensor data fusion and prediction research, VR Visual lag is reduced to 20 milliseconds. CTO Wang Mingyang Fireworks at the site for a more detailed technical explanation.Picture drift caused by 2, gyroscope, and interactive questions: V-1 joined the external nine-axis gyroscope, rather than rely on spotty phone gyroscopes.

In addition, Fireworks SDK on video playback API, there are also some optimizations.![Alt Instead of expecting Tencent\'s VR helmet, better take a look at this company\'s products](http://kenzo2016.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/783df833.jpeg)(V-1 prototype)With all that said, how do we experience? Lei feng\'s network (search for \"Lei feng\'s network\", public interest), reporters at the scene briefly experienced a rough hand and it is found that these basic did.Even so, Fireworks continued to believe that compared to standard Gear-Samsung VR VR cell phone boxes, they are still just as much as 80%, other 20% can\'t do because of the lack of phone support.V-1 in February 2016, the cost 199 Yuan.Therefore, a startup can do VR eco do?![Alt Instead of expecting Tencent\'s VR helmet, better take a look at this company\'s products](http://kenzo2016.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/78344ae1.jpeg)Fireworks workshop claimed to \"otherness\", to show to the outside world is a \"proud\" stance. From launches began Qian, they on said to \"offended about VR industry of peer\"; launches Shang specially in seat Shang prepared has popcorn, seems to to performances one tore forced drama; Lou pool also said, \"see with we of competition opponents do of things are is wrong of, does to has I is big of encourages\"; earlier left storm venture of Wang Mingyang times teases storm magic mirror \"a years Diego generation has four times, also is a box\".But the Fireworks good reputation in the industry, TVR Fang Xiangyuan said they simply \"naughty\".![Alt Instead of expecting Tencent\'s VR helmet, better take a look at this company\'s products](http://kenzo2016.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/7833486c.jpeg)(In Tencent VR and TVR founder Fang Xiangyuan Fireworks workshop activities, TVR launched a VR game in Gear on the VR, both are competing for such premium developer support) [Ted Baker iPhone 6](http://londonfashionblog.com/search/ted+baker+amilio+check+backpack+)On the VR environment, Fireworks view is because VR is still in its early stages, more important is to solve technical problems, improve hardware experience, also does not have to rely on the operating phase. , For example on the developer problem, Tencent has payment mechanism and developers share Lou Chi think it too early to consider this, more importantly users accumulated.And Yes, hardware stage software in an opera, to have eco-start with a good homemade VR helmets, in order to attract users and developers.[![Alt Ted Baker Note 3 Case](http://www.nodcase.com/images/large/note3/ted_baker_no070_lrg.jpg)](http://www.nodcase.com/ted-baker-samsung-galaxy-note-3-case-tanalia-p-4072.html)But reporters worry, while Fireworks ass the industry recognized, but branding, operations, attracting developers, hardware design and manufacturing, seems not much experience, a lack of effective planning, which is important for ecological construction.In any case, so a deep of VR technology startups, really can improve the experience of domestic VR products.PS. According to Wang Mingyang said, the original VR machine was easier than doing mobile VR box, because the former have more control on the hardware.![Alt Instead of expecting Tencent\'s VR helmet, better take a look at this company\'s products](http://kenzo2016.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/7839be16.jpeg)143 votesOculus Rift DK2 virtual glasses\rOculus Rift Development Kit 2 (DK2) compared to prior generation performance and specifications on further upgrades, one of the most significant changes is the screen.
